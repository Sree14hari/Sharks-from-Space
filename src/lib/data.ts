    id: "why-predict",
    question: "Why do shark location predictions matter?",
    answer:
      "Predicting shark locations is crucial for conservation efforts, allowing us to identify and protect critical habitats. It also enhances beach safety by providing early warnings for potential shark activity near coastal areas, reducing the risk of human-shark encounters.",

    id: "impact-on-humans",
    question: "What is the impact of sharks on marine ecosystems and humans?",
    answer:
      "Sharks are apex predators that play a vital role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems by keeping prey populations in check. For humans, beyond the rare negative encounters, sharks contribute to ecotourism and are a subject of scientific research that helps us understand the ocean's health.",

    id: "data-sources",
    question: "What are SWOT and PACE satellites?",
    answer:
      "SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) is a NASA satellite that measures the height of water in Earth's oceans, lakes, and rivers, providing high-resolution data on ocean circulation. PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) is a mission to study the color of the ocean to assess the health of marine phytoplankton, which are the base of the marine food web.",

    id: "tag-technology",
    question: "How does modern shark tagging technology work?",
    answer:
      "Modern shark tags are sophisticated devices equipped with sensors to track movement, depth, water temperature, and more. Satellite tags transmit data to orbiting satellites when the shark surfaces, providing near real-time location data. Other tags, like acoustic tags, ping receivers placed on the seafloor, while archival tags store data that can be retrieved if the tag is recovered.",
